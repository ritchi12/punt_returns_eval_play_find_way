### Submission for the 2022 NFL Big Data Bowl - Student Competition

This repository contains all code, figures, and citations used for our [Big Data Bowl submission]() along with additional punt return optimal path visualizations as generated by the algorithm outlined in our paper.

## Repository Directory

#### Code

Our code is divided into three folders:

1. Data Standardization: Our process of standardizing the data so that all punt returns are moving from left to right

2. Models: Our models for tackle probability and expected return yards.

3. Optimal Path: Our algorithm to determine the punt returner's optimal path given the defensive structure of the kicking team.

#### Figures from Paper

Figures from our paper can be found in the Figures folder.

#### Touchdown Plays from 2020

To view additional optimal path and convex hull animations for all 2020 touchdown plays, please see the "Optimal Path/Sample Plays" folder.
