### Submission for the 2022 NFL Big Data Bowl - Student Competition

This repository contains all code, figures, and citations used for our [Big Data Bowl submission]() along with additional punt return optimal path visualizations as generated by the algorithm outlined in our paper.

## Repository Directory

#### Code

Our code is divided into three folders:

1. Data Standardization: Our process of standardizing the data so that all punt returns are moving from left to right

2. Models: Our models for tackle probability and expected return yards.

3. Optimal Path: Our algorithm to determine the punt returner's optimal path given the defensive structure of the kicking team.

#### Figures from Paper

Figures from our paper can be found in the "Figures" folder.

#### Touchdown Plays from 2020

To view additional optimal path and convex hull animations for all 2020 touchdown plays, please see the "Optimal Path/Sample Plays" folder.


## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Dr. Tim Swartz, Dr. Tom Loughin, Dr. Alexandre Leblanc, and Tyrel Stokes for taking the time to provide guiance and feedback on our work. We would also like to thank Michael Lopez, the National Football League, and Pro Football Focus for graciously organizing this competition and providing such detailed and interesting data to work with.
